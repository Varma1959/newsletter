Let’s embark on this CI/CD journey together and unlock the potential for efficient and high-quality software delivery.



## What is a Docker


Docker is an open-source platform that simplifies the process of deploying and running applications within isolated environments called containers. It enables developers to package their applications along with all the necessary dependencies, libraries, and configurations into lightweight, portable containers. These containers are self-contained and can run consistently on any system that has Docker installed, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. Docker provides a standardized and efficient way to package, distribute, and deploy applications, making it easier to ensure consistent behavior across different environments. With Docker, developers can focus on building and shipping their applications without worrying about the intricacies of the underlying infrastructure, leading to improved productivity, faster deployment cycles, and increased scalability. Docker has gained widespread adoption due to its ability to streamline application development, deployment, and management processes, making it a fundamental tool in the modern software development ecosystem.



## Accelerate CI/CD with Ephemeral Environments


Gone are the days when manual testing and deployment used to take days to complete. These new tools automate and streamline the software development pipeline. Typically, whenever any application is created, it’s entered into a continuous integration (CI) tool or platform that tests the code through various frameworks. If the tests are passed, the code will be deployed.

However, increasing velocity is difficult if your processes and tools are tedious and complex to configure. That’s why ease of use is non-negotiable for every developer evaluating any new tool. Developers like a CI tool that’s not only easy to set up but can also scale to test their applications. Configuring infrastructure and other related tasks is daunting and time-consuming, taking resources away from deployments.

This is where a concept called ephemeral environments comes in. Ephemeral environments can be used to test your applications much faster by spinning up short-lived environment instances and automatically destroyed after the work is done. This tutorial will discuss ephemeral environments, how they work, and how to configure them.



## Deploying an Application on Kubernetes


Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It is a popular tool for container orchestration and provides a way to manage large numbers of containers as a single unit rather than having to manage each container individually.



## Importance of Kubernetes


Kubernetes has become an essential tool for managing and deploying modern applications, and its importance lies in its ability to provide a unified platform for automating and scaling the deployment, management, and scaling of applications. With Kubernetes, organizations can achieve increased efficiency and agility in their development and deployment processes, resulting in faster time to market and reduced operational costs. Kubernetes also provides a high degree of scalability, allowing organizations to scale their applications as their business grows and evolves easily.

Today, we will see how to automate simple application deployment on Kubernetes using RazorOps

```sh
gulp build dist --prod
```

## Docker

Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
